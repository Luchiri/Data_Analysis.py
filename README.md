This Python script demonstrates data loading, exploration, basic analysis, and visualization using the Iris dataset. It includes:
- Loading the dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_iris() and converting it into a pandas DataFrame.
- Displaying basic statistics, checking for missing values, and performing group-wise analysis based on species.
- Creating four different types of visualizations: line chart, bar chart, histogram, and scatter plot.
- The script utilizes pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn for data manipulation and visualization.
